                <h3>Client Report</h3>
                <a href="#"><p>My website if I ever get it</p></a>
                <p>
                   Sorry to report that initially I had good contact with the Lead Developer, but he ghosted me and never contacted me again. He never even gave me his email to send him the outline.
                   I decided to use the content and images for my website out of convience, ChatGPT was able to provide me with fake information and images for fake projects, I want to make a real portfolio someday, but didn't want this one done legitimate yet.
                   Next time I "hire" someone to do the job I'll make sure they actually do the job. 
                   I was excited to see my website, a shame.

                <h3>Lead Dev Report</h3>
                <a target="_blank" href="https://jared1883.github.io/wdd130-williams/"><p>David William's Website</p></a>
                <p>
                    The Home page is done, none of the sub pages have been worked on yet. Will update this page when needed.
                    One of the junior developers was pretty responsive and the other one did not communicate at all.
                    Communication with the client was great, issues were resolved promptly.
                    I enjoyed managing my site with Github, it went well.

                <h3>Jr. Dev Report</h3>
                <a target="_blank" href="https://ooheap.github.io/wdd130-minty/"><p>Minty Paradice</p></a>
                <a href="#"><p>Other Link if I ever get it</p></a>
                <p>
                    To be completely honest, one of my projects in which I was junior developer they completed the whole project without me because the client turned in the outline late, and the other one has not even been started by the Lead Developer.
                    I wish I had been given the chance to actually work as a junior developer on at least one of the projects, it would've been fun and I'm sure I would've learned something.

                <h3>Reflection and Experiences</h3>
                <p>
                    The most challenging part of the project was communication with my groupmates, other than that it was figuring out how to do the website exactly according to the specifications of my client.
                    I enjoyed using Github, and I also enjoyed having a little bit of creative freedom in designing the website, but also having an exact plan.
                    I'm definitely more confident in my CSS now, so I'm sure I'd be a lot faster.
                    I do feel more confident working on real projects, even though I only worked on one website, I feel like my time working on that website was really good for making me think about what making a real website would be like.
